this voice assistant script uses livekit to accomplish realtime audio chat.  this configuration uses TTS to STT and there is a noticable latency compared to the realtime api. Livekit supports Realtime, so I need to configure the script to use it.

To run the application, run from the terminal.
    cd VoiceAssistant
    python Talk.py start
