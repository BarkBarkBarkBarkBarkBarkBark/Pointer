# OpenAI Realtime API Python Edition

Python implementation of OpenAI's realtime API

Guide [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime)

API Ref [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events)

OpenAI have sample code ([openai-realtime-console](https://github.com/openai/openai-realtime-console)) but it is JavaScript-based.

So here's a start at a Python implementation.


# Getting it running

- Create a Virtual Environment if you want to: `python -m venv .venv ;  ./.venv/bin/activate`

- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Create a `.env` file like `.env.template` filling in your OpenAI API key

- Run it: `python realtime-simple.py`


# Vision

It would be nice to clean this up to act as a fully-featured Python API for this service.
